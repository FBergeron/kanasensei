HelpText=GOAL\n\nTo help learning Japanese kanas (katakanas and hiraganas).\n\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nInitially, KanaSensei is set to ask all the phonetic symbols composing the kana set shown.\n\nWe recommend beginners to disable this option.  To do this, deselect "All the kanas" in the "Options" menu.  Then, you can choose the desired columns of kanas you would like to learn by clicking the corresponding checkboxes on the kana keyboard.  This way, you can progress at your own pace.\n\nWhen you feel comfortable with all the kanas, you can reset this option at "Select all kanas".  In this case, the checked columns will be ignored.  Instead, all the symbols will be asked by KanaSensei.\n\nOnce all the selected kanas have been asked once, the test will be over.  Your score will be shown on the top-right display.\n\nTo begin a new test, you can select "New Test" from the "Options" menu, or you can check (or uncheck) a column of kanas from the kana keyboard.\n\nThe option "Infinite Test" allows KanaSensei to ask the selected kanas recursively, so you can memorize the Japanese symbols quickly.  To terminate the test, change the options or close the application.\n\nThe "View" menu alters the interrogative mode of the test so you can learn all the different representations in romaji, katakana and hirahana of the Japanese phonetic symbols.\n\n\nNOTES\n\nParticle O is terminated by an asterisk(*) to differentiate it from the phonetic symbol O.\n\nThere are two (2) ways, in Japanese kanas, to express the sounds JI and ZU.  The least frequently used are terminated by an asterisk(*) to differentiate them.
